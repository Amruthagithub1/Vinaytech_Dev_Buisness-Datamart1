Today Major changes in the demo

Data-->Power Platform Hierarchy

Data: 	Anything you are able to store in IT is called as data.
	We have 3 types of data in IT 
	a) Structured data
		Table format [column by column]
		Databases, Excel etc..
	b) Semi-Structured Data
		Partial Structure
		Ex: Log files, Event Viewers, Journal Info etc...
	c) Unstuctured Data
		Social Media
		Satellite Signal
		PDF, Word etc.

Where exactly we use this?
	Majorly two types of IT applications
	a) Business Processing Applications [OLTP: Online Transaction Processing Applications]
		Front End(Web, Desktop, Mobile or Tab app)---> Back-End (Databases, Files etc.)
		General Public
		Ex: Irctc, Bookmyshow etc.
		Pnrno, amount, startst, endst, noof pass, date, train no etc..
		[Structured Data applications]
		
		Traansaction Successful / Transaction failed

	b) Business Analysis Applications [1990'...]
		As the data increasing in the IT storages, there is challenge for analysis.
		Analytical applications / Decision Making applications / BI applications
		Bi: Business Intelligence: Intelligence to the business: Decision Making 

		Managers / analysts / CEOs / VPs etc.
		
		Ex: 
		How many trains having full booking
		Trains having normal booking
		Trains having NO booking
		Region having highest sale of tickets
		Train having highest booking...

		Data---> BI Applications [BI Process]--->BI Data

	Data--> ETL Layer-->DWH-->Semantic Components--> PResentation [Reports or Dashboards]-->BI Data

			Report:
				Individual Operation specification component [Low level]
				Many visuals [a component with data or data+graphical] 
				More Sized Visuals
				Organization may have multiple reports
				Ex: Withdraw report, Deposits reports
			Dashboard
				A specific subject area high level data presentation
				Limited visuals and cute visuals
				Multiple reports information consolidated area
				Ex: Savings account dashboard with deposuts and withdrawals

		Initial BI applications: [Legacy BI]: Limited capability
			a) Multiple tools required 
			b) Multiple resources
			c) Multiple setups

			d) Reporting capacibility very less [ limited users, limited reports, limited data]
			
		MSBI
			Microsoft Business Intelligence-2005 
			Suite with multiple tools [SSIS, SSAS, SSRS, DQS, MDS etc.]
			
			MSBI versions-2005, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019,2022
			From 2008 ...Microsoft is the leader in Analytics and BI

			Adv than legacy:
			a) Simple to install, single suite for end-end operations
			b) Single or multiple resources 
			c) More friendly for MS applications

			
			Google, Facebook, Twitter...many social media applications...after 2005...
			Cloud available end of 2009 ...
			Mobile apps and tab apps...after 2012 ...

			
			Power BI: "Adding more Power to the existing BI" : Powering BI
			a) Cloud operations
			b) Mobile and Tab friendly
			c)  Any type, Any where, Any Format [100s of sources...]
			d) Embedding possible
				[Facebook page<--Power BI]
			e) SSBI Application [Single application{Power Bi Desktop} to perform end-end BI
					operations]


			Power BI : Monthly updates [ no versions]
			July 2013---July 2022
			Every month they have update

		Till 2019, Power BI Standalone application

		But, now it is under Power Platform.
		
		Power Platform: 
		" A strong platform from Microsoft to perform different types of services with Less Code / No Code"
		
		5 Sub Components in Power Platform [We will discuss this tomorrow]

		Power BI Definitions [Detailed-Tomorrow]

		Case Study: To explain the ease of operations in PBI to convert Normal Data--> Decision Making Data
			[ Also you learn about Self Service BI operations in Power BI]


		Normal Data--> Power BI Desktop-->Decision Making Data
		Desktop: The place where we perform multiple GUI operations
		Power BI Desktop: Power BI multiple operations graphically performing area.
